		<h1>Under Construction!</h1>
		<p>
			This is technically my second website. Previously, I was using Squarespace to host a template built website consisting of descriptions on all my major projects. The only problem was that no one is considered a proficient programmer unless their website has an early 2000s feel. In that case, I had to make sure my background color was an eyesore and the contents to be displayed in a list manner.

		<h2>What I am currently learning</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>GPU Architecture and GPU-Accelerated Programming</strong><br>
			After learning graphics programming and understanding the graphics pipeline, I wanted to learn the more low level details surrounding the GPU. I initially started by learning Vulkan (low level graphics framework) in order to fully understand how data is manipulated in the GPU, but I still had some questions regarding the way information is processed in the GPU. I bought 3 different books that are about GPU Architecture and how to utilize it via Nvidia's CUDA. Not only did I find books, but I also found Caltech's course website on CUDA and GPU-accelerated programming.
