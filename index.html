			This is technically my second website. Previously, I was using Squarespace to host a template built website consisting of descriptions on all my major projects. The only problem was that no one is considered a proficient programmer unless their website has an early 2000s feel. In that case, I had to make sure my background color was an eyesore and the contents to be displayed in a list manner.
