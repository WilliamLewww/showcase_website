    <h1>Under Construction!</h1>
    <p>
      This is technically my second website. Previously, I was using Squarespace to host a template built website consisting of descriptions on all my major projects. The only problem was that no one is considered a proficient programmer unless their website has an early 2000s feel. In that case, I had to make sure my background color was an eyesore and the contents to be displayed in a list manner.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>cuda_raytrace <a href="https://github.com/WilliamLewww/cuda_raytrace">(repository)</a></strong><br>
      The project originally started as a ray-traced image renderer that would process a scene with shadows and recursive reflections, but as the scene became more complex, the time required to generate the image grew exponentially. To combat the increasing time, the renderer was re-implemented using CUDA to utilize GPU-acceleration. The efficiency boost was significant enough to be viable in a real-time engine. The engine utilizes OpenGL's interoperability with CUDA in order to update a ray-traced scene in real-time.<br>

    <h2>What I am currently learning</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>GPU Architecture and GPU-Accelerated Programming</strong><br>
      After learning graphics programming and understanding the graphics pipeline, I wanted to learn the more low level details surrounding the GPU. I initially started by learning Vulkan (low level graphics framework) in order to fully understand how data is manipulated in the GPU, but I still had some questions regarding the way information is processed in the GPU. I bought 3 different books that are about GPU Architecture and how to utilize it via Nvidia's CUDA. Not only did I find books, but I also found Caltech's course website on CUDA and GPU-accelerated programming.

      <strong>3D Modeling</strong><br>
      In highschool, I always wanted to create 3D models but the complex software would always drive me away. Now that I am older, I am much more proficient at learning new concepts and college is the best time to learn new things :) .
